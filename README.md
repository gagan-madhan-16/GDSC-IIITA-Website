## Contribution Guidelines :key:

1. While applying UI Components, let the colors be the 4 main colors of Google symbols.

1. Before starting to work on any issue pull the latest commits in Repo that is, before committing changes to the local repo, pull the latest commits, and then commit. Resolve all merge conflicts and then only merge. 

1. After you finish the issue work, check if all the features are working as before. If not, refer to the previous code, resolve the error, and merge to the master branch.
